suyac
=====

Command-line based REST client for testing. Built out of frustration with tools
such as Postman and Insomnia starting as free and useful programs and eventually
moving to for-profit models when all I used them for was a quick testing
environment. This tool was created to fulfill the need for testing and provide a
way to do so from CLI as a bonus.

Suyac (comes from suya-curl).
